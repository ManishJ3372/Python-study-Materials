# 1. WAP to check whether given number is prime or not

# A prime number is a natural number greater than 1
# that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
# The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦.}.

# 2. WAP to check palindrome for string and number both

# A palindrome is a number or letter that
# remains the same even if the number and letters are inverted.
# For example:
# 121, 11, 414, 1221, 74747 are the palindrome numbers.
# MOM, DAD, MADAM, REFER are the palindrome letters.
# JAVATPOINT, PROGRAM, JAVA are not the palindrome letters.

# 3. WAP to check given value(string to number) is armstrong or not

# the sum of cubes of each digit is equal to the number itself

# All other terms are obtained by adding the preceding two terms.
# This means to say the nth term is the sum of (n-1)th and (n-2)th term.
